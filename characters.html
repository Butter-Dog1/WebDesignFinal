                    <h2>Ikora</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Ikora Rey is a human and the Vanguard of the Warlock class. Once the disciple of Osiris, Ikora's extensive knowledge of her field has earned her respect amongst all Warlock Orders and led to her replacing her exiled mentor as Vanguard. Ikora also oversees The Hidden, an extensive network of Guardians who serve as the Vanguard's secret intelligence gatherers. From her position, Ikora helped navigate The Last City's survival against numerous threats, although her secretive nature sometimes set her at odds with fellow Vanguard leaders and friends Commander Zavala and Cayde-6.</p>

                    <h2>Zavala</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Commander Zavala is an Awoken Guardian who serves as the Vanguard of the Titan class, and overall Vanguard Commander of The Last City. Stern and uncompromising, Zavala's only goal is to safeguard humanity within the Last City against all threats. He oversees all Guardian military operations, and led the Guardians to victory in both the Taken War and Red War. In the aftermath of both conflicts, Zavala has become increasingly isolated and reluctant to commit Guardians to conflicts outside of the Last City.</p>
